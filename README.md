# SPACE_SHOOTER_2D_GAME

This repository consists of two folders:

1)**space_shooter_build_game**: This folder contains the built game for this project. Simply run the 'Asteroids.exe' file to start the game. When running the game for the first time, Windows might display a message stating 'Windows Protected Your PC.' Click on 'More Info,' which indicates that this message is due to an **Unknown Publisher**, and then click on 'Run Anyway' to proceed.
2)**space_shooter_project_files**: This folder contains all project files except for Library(due to greater file size). In order to run this project, create a new Unity 2D project. Then paste these files in your new created project files. [Incase of Untitled Scene, go to Scenes folder and open the Gameplay Scene] .
